# Claude Code Logger

A specialized HTTP/HTTPS proxy logger designed for analyzing and debugging [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) traffic with enhanced chat mode visualization.

## 🎯 Primary Purpose

This tool was built specifically to help developers understand and debug the communication between Claude Code and the Anthropic API. It provides a clean, formatted view of the conversation flow, making it easier to:

- Debug Claude Code behavior
- Analyze API requests and responses
- Monitor token usage and quotas
- Understand the structure of system prompts and tool usage
- Archive conversations for later analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start (No Installation Required!)

Simply run these two commands in separate terminals:

**Terminal 1 - Start the logger:**
```bash
npx claude-code-logger start
```

**Terminal 2 - Start Claude Code with proxy:**
```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/ claude
```

That's it! You'll now see a beautifully formatted log of all Claude Code interactions in your terminal.

For help and options:
```bash
npx claude-code-logger start --help
```

## 🔍 Usage Examples

### Claude Code Logging (Primary Use Case)
```bash
# Basic usage - logs Claude Code conversations
npm run dev -- start
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/ claude

# With full prompt visibility
npm run dev -- start --verbose
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/ claude

# With debug information
npm run dev -- start --debug
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/ claude

# Log to file for later analysis
npm run dev -- start 2>&1 | tee claude-session-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
```

### General Proxy Usage
```bash
# Proxy any HTTP service
npm run dev -- start -p 3000 -h example.com -r 80 --https=false --chat-mode=false

# Log all traffic with bodies
npm run dev -- start -h api.example.com --log-body --chat-mode=false

# Debug mode for troubleshooting
npm run dev -- start --debug --log-body --chat-mode=false
```

## 📸 What You'll See

In chat mode (default), the output is clean and focused:

```
🚀 Proxy server started on http://localhost:8000
📡 Forwarding to https://api.anthropic.com:443
📝 Logging all traffic to console...

👤 How do I read a file in Python?

🤖 To read a file in Python, you can use the built-in `open()` function. Here are the most common approaches:

### Basic File Reading

```python
# Read entire file content
with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

... (formatted markdown output) ...
```
